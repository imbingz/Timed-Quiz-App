### 1. Project Context - User Story
* A coding bootcamp student takes a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores to gauge his/her progress compared to other peers. 
* When the start button is clicked, the timer starts and the user will be presented with a question. When a question is answered, the user will be presented with another question. 
* When a question is answered incorrectly, the time is subtracted from the clock. 
* When all questions are answered, or the timer reaches 0, then the quiz is over. 
* The user can save his/her initials and score.

* Create an event handler for the start button. 
  * When the button is licked, the timer will start to count down 
  * When the button is clicked, the question will be displayed with answer options, the start button will disappear from screen. 
* When the queston is answered, another question with answer options will be presented
* If the answer is wrong, time will be subtracted from the timer as penalty. 
* When all the questions are answered, or timer is 0, whichever happens sooner, the quiz is over. 
* Compare score of each play and store the high score along with initials.
* Display the high score to user without displaying questions/options and start button. 
* User has options to try again or back to homepage.
