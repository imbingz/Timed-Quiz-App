### 1. Project Context - User Story
A coding bootcamp student takes a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores to gauge his/her progress compared to other peers. 

<a name = "objectives"></a>
### 2. Project Objectives
* Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria (numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters and symbols).
* This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 
* The password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
* It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.(I used the given HTML & CSS files mostly)

### 6. Pseudocode - Logic Steps
* After the 'click' event, the users will be prompted to enter the password length. 
* Need a variable that holds the users input. 
* Check if the users input is a number between 8 and 128. 
* If not(such as letters, null, space, symbols, or numbers out of range), keep prompting until the input is as desired. 
* Ask users whether they would like their passwords to contain numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters and symbols. 
* Create a variable to hold each answer. 
* If users select no to all questions, then ask these questions again. 
* Collect user preference and assign to a variable.
* Generate random password characters.
* Create a variable that holds the sum of those random characters.

I would like to thank my TA Katie @fkakatie(https://github.com/fkakatie) for her guidance and efforts to help me understand the landscape of this project and some of the aspects I need to consider and learn more about before even starting to build anything. I also want to thank my fellow coder Kyle Murray @theykay(https://github.com/theykay) who took time helping me fix a bug in my original file after a day of searching for a solution. The following materials contribute to the completion of this project too.
